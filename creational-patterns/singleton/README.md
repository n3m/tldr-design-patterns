# TLDR; Design Patterns - Creational Patterns :: Singleton

## Description

- The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to it. It is commonly used when you need to have a single, shared instance of a class throughout your application.

## Applications

- By using the Singleton pattern, you can have a centralized, shared instance of a class that can be accessed from anywhere in your code, providing a convenient way to manage global state or resources.

## Examples

[\[Golang\] Example](golang/application.go)
[\[Typescript\] Example](typescript/index.ts)
