# TLDR; Design Patterns - Creational Patterns :: Singleton

## Description

- A singleton is a design that only lets you instantiate once an object/struct/class etc... while providing global access to such instance.

## Applications

- Use the singleton pattern when you need to ensure that only one instance of a class is created.
- Use the singleton pattern when you need stricter control over global variables

## Examples

[\[Golang\] DB Instance Example](golang/application.go)
