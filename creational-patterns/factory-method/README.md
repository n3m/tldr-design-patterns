# TLDR; Design Patterns - Creational Patterns :: Factory Method

## Description

- The Factory Method is a design pattern that lets you generate instances of a parent instance, but with a different type.

## Applications

- Use the factory method when you don't know beforehand all the types or implementations of a category in your code.
- Use the Factory Method when you want to extend the usability of a single module, before it is developed.

## Examples

[\[Golang\] Transport Example](golang/application.go)
